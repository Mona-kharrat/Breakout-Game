# Breakout-Game

 In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball 
 off a paddle into them. The arcade game was released in Japan by Namco. 
 Breakout was a worldwide commercial success, among the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1976 in both the United States and 
 Japan and then among the top three highest-grossing arcade video games of 1977 in the US and Japan.
